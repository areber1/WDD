    <h2>Austin Reber</h2>
    <p>Hey all my name is Austin Reber, I'm a CIT major and I havn't had a huge interest in web design
        but I have some family members who were needing some help with their websites and I figured if I could
        learn how website design works then I guess I could build them a simple website. That is why I'm in this course.
        I've been married for 9 years this year and we have a 7 year old son named Odin.
        That's me!
